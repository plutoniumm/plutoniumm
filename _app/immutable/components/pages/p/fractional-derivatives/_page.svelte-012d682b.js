We usually find derivatives of functions at integer orders, such as 1st, 2nd,
etc. But what if we want to find the derivative in a non-integer order, like
0.5? What would that even mean? It would naturally be something where, if
applied twice, it would be the same as the 1st derivative

`),h=new o(!1),g=t(`

First and foremost, we define `),x=new o(!1),f=t(` as the kth derivative operator.
We can start by trying to reverse engineer the kth derivative of `),l=new o(!1),b=t(`
which, in general, is

`),D=new o(!1),W=t(`

What if we were to convert the factorial to a gamma function and then use that
to evaluate the derivative in a non-integer order? So then,

`),G=new o(!1),S=t(`. We can
now apply this twice to get the 1st derivative:

`),T=new o(!1),q=t(`

So one can then see that `),F=new o(!1),I=t(`. This
also tells us that we can generalize the derivative operator to arbitrary real
numbers, not just integers. We can even use imaginary numbers, but that's a much
different conversation.

`),y=Hn("h3"),qn=t("Derivatives of "),pn=new o(!1),gn=t(`

`),H=new o(!1),N=t(`. From the pattern, we would expect that
`),_=new o(!1),A=t(", which would imply "),O=new o(!1),j=t(`.
It is trivial to see, if we apply `),M=new o(!1),R=t(" twice, we get "),V=new o(!1),X=t(`
back. So then what happens if we feed in `),E=new o(!1),J=Fn(),L=new o(!1),P=t(`

So, we can see taking the imaginary derivative of a real function gives us a
complex coefficient. We can now even try to find `),Q=new o(!1),Y=t(" which would be "),C=new o(!1),K=t(`
or `),U=new o(!1),Z=t(`. Now that we took the imaginary derivative of
a complex function, we got a real coefficient. In general, we can safely say
that non-integer derivatives may give us a real or complex result. Now if we
want a the derivative of say `),nn=new o(!1),an=t(", we can represent "),en=new o(!1),tn=t(`
and then proceed from there. One can verify that `),rn=new o(!1),on=t(`.
So, the differential operator is simply a shifting operator for the sinusoidal
function. But now that we've asked the question of an imaginary derivative, we
are forced to ask. What is `),sn=new o(!1),fn=t(`?

`),$=Hn("h3"),xn=t(`
