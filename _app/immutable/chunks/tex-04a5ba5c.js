groff is the primary front end to the GNU roff document formatting system. GNU roff is a typesetting system that reads plain text input files that include formatting commands to produce output <span class="token keyword">in</span> PostScript, PDF, HTML, DVI, or other formats, or <span class="token keyword">for</span> display to a terminal. Formatting commands can be low-level typesetting primitives, macros from a supplied package, or user-defined macros. All three approaches can be combined. If no <span class="token function">file</span> operands are specified, or <span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token function">file</span> is “-”, groff reads the standard input stream.</code>`,l(e,ga,c),l(e,Ie,c),a(Ie,Kn),l(e,ka,c),l(e,Ce,c),a(Ce,$n),l(e,va,c),l(e,xe,c),a(xe,bt),a(bt,zn)},p:eo,i:eo,o:eo,d(e){e&&t(L),e&&t(It),e&&t(U),e&&t(Ct),e&&t(F),e&&t(xt),e&&t(T),e&&t(Ht),e&&t(X),e&&t(Lt),e&&t(J),e&&t(Dt),e&&t(V),e&&t(Pt),e&&t(K),e&&t(Ot),e&&t(W),e&&t(St),e&&t($),e&&t(Mt),e&&t(R),e&&t(_t),e&&t(z),e&&t(At),e&&t(Z),e&&t(Gt),e&&t(u),e&&t(Wt),e&&t(Q),e&&t(Rt),e&&t(I),e&&t(Yt),e&&t(ee),e&&t(Bt),e&&t(te),e&&t(Nt),e&&t(ae),e&&t(jt),e&&t(se),e&&t(qt),e&&t(ne),e&&t(Ut),e&&t(m),e&&t(Ft),e&&t(oe),e&&t(Xt),e&&t(S),e&&t(Jt),e&&t(M),e&&t(Vt),e&&t(v),e&&t(Kt),e&&t(_),e&&t($t),e&&t(A),e&&t(zt),e&&t(re),e&&t(Zt),e&&t(k),e&&t(Qt),e&&t(ce),e&&t(ea),e&&t(le),e&&t(ta),e&&t(pe),e&&t(aa),e&&t(he),e&&t(sa),e&&t(ue),e&&t(na),e&&t(fe),e&&t(oa),e&&t(me),e&&t(ra),e&&t(ke),e&&t(ia),e&&t(ve),e&&t(ca),e&&t(ye),e&&t(la),e&&t(Ee),e&&t(pa),e&&t(we),e&&t(ha),e&&t(B),e&&t(ua),e&&t(N),e&&t(da),e&&t(be),e&&t(fa),e&&t(Te),e&&t(ma),e&&t(j),e&&t(ga),e&&t(Ie),e&&t(ka),e&&t(Ce),e&&t(va),e&&t(xe)}}}const Nr={title:"Why Tex is Crap",desc:"Why I am unable to can deal with TeX and the absolute dinosaur that it is.
