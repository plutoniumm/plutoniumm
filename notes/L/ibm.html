    <p>All corporations have some amazing Ls. This is just those for what is effectively the world’s oldest computer company. These are not failures in business or technology (like say the clusterfuck of Watson Healthcare<a href="https://theconversation.com/from-a-deranged-provocateur-to-ibms-failed-ai-superproject-the-controversial-story-of-how-data-has-transformed-healthcare-189362" rel="nofollow">[0.1]</a>), but rather in ethics and morality.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sidenote: To be fair Watson healthcare is sort of an ethical failure too since Ferrucci, the guy who created said Watson said it’s not ready for outside of games and Big Blue decided to put it to use in Healthcare <a href="https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IBMs-Watson-recommended-unsafe-and-incorrect-cancer-treatments-STAT.pdf" rel="nofollow">[0.2]</a>. Now that’s a whole new meaning to putting in Jeopardy!</p></blockquote>
<h2>Part 1: Briberies and Corruption</h2>
<ul><li>Argentina (1993-2000)<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/03/09/business/ibm-contends-with-a-scandal-in-argentina.html" rel="nofollow">[1.1]</a> \
In 1993-2000 IBM was reported to have bribed government officials in Argentina to win a $250 million contract to modernize the computer systems of <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caso_IBM-Banco_Naci%C3%B3n" rel="nofollow">Banco de la Nación Argentina</a>. IBM not only was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB977440372530767305" rel="nofollow">fined</a> $300K for this but they also pledged to never do it again.</li>
<li>South Korea/China (2004-2009) <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704608504576208634150691292" rel="nofollow">[1.2]</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN18103187/" rel="nofollow">[1.3]</a>  \
In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2011/comp21889.pdf" rel="nofollow">2011 lawsuit</a> 100s of IBM employees created slush funds with local travel agencies in China and South Korea to pay for travel expenses of government officials among other gifts. IBM was fined $10 million for this.</li>
<li>India (2011-2014) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/24/ibm-india-battles-fraud-amid-scramble-to-save-its-2-5b-airtel-contract/" rel="nofollow">[1.4]</a> \
IBM’s Bharti Airtel contract was reduced from $2.5B to less than $400M as fraud schemes were discovered with employees involving Mara Ison. They even overstated revenues by over $8 million.</li>
<li>Australia (2013-2016) <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/queenslands-ibm-ban-lives-on-420969" rel="nofollow">[1.5]</a> \
IBM was found to do bid rigging and price fixing in a contract with Queensland. They used leaked information about competitors and attempting to access tender responses such as by Accenture and Logica to win a contract. They were subsequently banned from doing business with the state for 12 months.</li>
<li>Canada (2015) <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/ibm-revenue-quebec-employees-arrested-in-upac-raid-1.2990211" rel="nofollow">[1.6]</a> \
7 people including officials from Revenue Quebec and IBM were arrested for bribery. IBM was accused of paying bribes to Revenue Quebec officials to win a $24M contract.</li></ul>
<h2>Part 2: Research</h2>
<h3>Patent Trolling</h3>
<p><strong>Groupon</strong><a href="https://www.markmanadvisors.com/blog/2018/8/2/is-ibm-a-patent-troll" rel="nofollow">[2.0]</a>:
For many years in a row with barely any gaps IBM has been the highest patent filer in the US. This is not a bad thing, but it does raise the question of what they do with all these patents.<a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/Ibm-innovation-2022" rel="nofollow">[2.1]</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A Patent Troll is normally defined as a company that does not produce anything the product itself i.e a Non-Practicing Entity (NPE) that buys patents and then sues others for infringement.</p></blockquote>
<p>In March 2016, IBM sued Groupon for 4 patents under US Patent numbers:</p>
<ul><li>5,796,967: Method for presenting applications in an interactive service</li>
<li>7,072,849: Method for presenting advertising content to users in an interactive service</li>
<li>5,961,601: Method and system for preserving state in computers communicating over networks</li>
<li>7,631,346: User-authentication method for a ‘single-sign-on’ within a federated computing environment</li></ul>
<p>IBM just won a jury verdict against Groupon for $82.5M.  Does that make IBM a patent troll</p>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong>: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/11/04/ibm-claims-twitter-infringes-on-at-least-3-of-its-patents-according-to-twitters-latest-s-1-update/" rel="nofollow">[2.2]</a></p>
<ul><li>6,957,224: Efficient retrieval of URLs</li>
<li>7,072,849: Method for presenting advertising in an interactive service</li>
<li>7,099,862: Programmatic discovery of common contacts</li></ul>
<p>IBM for some reason is also going to now pretend to “fight patent trolls” as if its not just another business opportunity for then <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/news/252476909/IBM-expands-patent-troll-fight-with-its-massive-IP-portfolio" rel="nofollow">[2.3]</a></p>
<h3>Deep Blue <a href="https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Deep_Thinking/ffYZDQAAQBAJ" rel="nofollow">[2.1]</a></h3>
<p>From Garry Kasparov’s book “Deep Thinking” we know that IBM was willing to push the boundaries of ethical behaviour to improve Deep Blue’s chances in any way. Here are excerpts from the book:</p>
<p>Miguel Illescas [chess player who worked for IBM], gave an interview in 2009 “New In Chess”, where he said</p>
<blockquote><p>“Every morning we had meetings with all the team, the engineers, communication people, everybody. […] I will tell you something which was very secret. […] One day I said, Kasparov speaks to Dokhoian after the games. I would like to know what they say. Can we change the security guard, and replace him by someone that speaks Russian? The next day they changed the guy, so I knew what they spoke about after the game.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In the same interview he went on to say, about the 6th game</p>
<blockquote><p>“We were looking at all kinds of rubbish such as 1. e4 a6 or 1. e4 b6, giving as many forced moves to the computer as we could. On this same morning we also introduced the move Nxe6 in the Caro Kann (Defence) played on the same day that Kasparov played it. That very morning we told Deep Blue: if Garry plays h6, take on e6 and don’t check the database. Just play, don’t think.” This was his bet, that the machine would never like this piece sacrifice for a pawn. And indeed, if we had given freedom to deep blue to choose, he would have never played it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other way to say it is Kasparov could have been playing a specific variant of Caro Kann which he expected would not be in the openings book of Deep Blue. So the engineers just hard coded the move rather than letting the computer decide.</p>
<p>In hindsight while we know computers are better than humans at chess, it is interesting to see how IBM was willing to push the boundaries of ethical behaviour to improve Deep Blue’s chances in any way by adding human assistance to the computer.</p>
<p><em>Deep Blue was not designed to be good at chess. It was designed to beat Garry Kasparov.</em> Which means, there is a good chance that if it played the 2nd best, or the same game with a different player, it may have lost.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that IBM retired Deep Blue after the match, and it was never used again.</p>
<p>Some Notes</p>
<ul><li>IBM was required by contract to give Kasparov a copy of the Deep Blue’s ‘previous games’ database. They did not citing: “the games were played with engineers not publicly so therefore no played public games exist”.</li>
<li>The famous ‘counterintuitive move as a sign of superior intelligence’ was actually a bug in the software. The move was a result of a bug in the software that caused the computer to make a random move.<a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/09/deep-blue-computer-bug/" rel="nofollow">[2.2]</a></li>
<li>After the match, IBM stock jumped 20%.</li></ul>
<h2>Part 3: Human Rights</h2>
<h3>Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft (DeHoMaG)</h3>
<p>IBM’s involvement in human rights abuses, particularly during the Holocaust, is a well-documented and controversial topic starting from the acquisition of Dehomag. Nazi Germany in 1933 was in fact the largest customer of IBM outside of the US<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_the_Holocaust" rel="nofollow">[3.0]</a></p>
<p>IBM acquired a German company, Dehomag, in 1922, which became its subsidiary in Germany. This acquisition allowed IBM to have a strong presence in the German market, but it also exposed the company to the political and social changes in the country. <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=34689" rel="nofollow">[3.1]</a></p>
<p>Nazi Germany and IBM’s Operations: When the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, IBM found itself operating in a country whose government was violently suppressing political dissent and engaging in intimidation and discrimination against Jews. Despite this, IBM continued to operate in Germany, and its German affiliate, Dehomag, became the second most profitable company for IBM in the 1930s</p>
<p>Use of IBM Technology by the Nazis: The Nazi regime used IBM’s Hollerith tabulating machines, which were essentially the mainframe computers of their era, to identify and track Jews and other minorities, manage slave labor, and run concentration camps <a href="https://www.wired.com/2001/02/did-ibm-help-nazis-in-wwii/" rel="nofollow">[3.2]</a>. These machines were used to create cross-indexes of names, family histories, addresses, business records, and bank accounts of citizens, allowing the Nazis to efficiently carry out their policies of persecution and extermination</p>
<p>Watson was even awarded the Merit Cross of the German Eagle with Star by Hitler in 1937.</p>
<p>IBM New York established a special subsidiary in the occupied General Government territory, Watson Business Machines, to deal with railway traffic there during the Holocaust in Poland. The German Transport Ministry used IBM machines under the New York-controlled subsidiary in Warsaw, not the German subsidiary. Watson Business Machines operated a punch card printing shop near the Warsaw Ghetto. The punch cards bore the indicia of the German subsidiary Dehomag<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/The-business-of-making-the-trains-to-Auschwitz-2821685.php" rel="nofollow">[3.3]</a>.</p>
<p>While it has criticized Black’s research methods and accusatory conclusions. IBM has never directly denied any of assertions in the book.</p>
<p>In 2004, the Roma human rights organization Gypsy International Recognition and Compensation Action (GIRCA) filed suit against IBM in Switzerland. However, the case was dismissed in 2006 under the relevant statute of limitations.</p>
<h2>Part 4: Market Capture and Anti-Trust</h2>
<h3>Red Hat</h3>
<p>Despite being the company that finally ended the Unix Wars<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_wars" rel="nofollow">[4.0]</a> in SCO vs IBM<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group,_Inc._v._International_Business_Machines_Corp." rel="nofollow">[4.1]</a>. IBM later ended up purchasing Red Had Enterprise Linux in 2019 and in 2023 went on to fully closed source it.</p>
<p>The argument IBM used was that it was struggling to pay its developers and therefore decided to close source it<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hats-commitment-open-source-response-gitcentosorg-changes" rel="nofollow">[4.2]</a>. It is worth noting however that REHL was a fully profitable company WHILE being open sourced before IBM even laid their eyes on it.</p>
<h3>Anti-Trust</h3>
<p>IBM has been sued by America for Anti-Trust multiple times, so much so that I’m not even going to explain but just list it</p>
