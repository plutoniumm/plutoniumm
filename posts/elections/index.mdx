Let's consider the fictitious city of Rationalia who's sitting president is Neil Degrasse Tyson. Lets then see how to hack the elections and hacking the hacks and so on. We'll also look for better election systems alltogether too.

// In US House of representatives the proportions of seats are given as per the state population. So a state with a higher population will have more seats in the house of representatives.
## Apportionment
Lets say Rationalia has 2 states Reasongrad and Analyticaland. So lets now divide 5 seats between the states as follows with 2 cases just to see how we round them

<div class="f tc mx-a j-ar scroll-x">
<Table
titles={["state", "population", "share"]}
rows={[
  ["<b>Case 1</b>", "", ""],
  ["Reasongrad", 2200, "44%"],
  ["Analyticaland", 2800, "56%"],
  ["<b>Case 2</b>", "", ""],
  ["Reasongrad", 2510, "51%"],
  ["Analyticaland", 2390, "49%"],
]} />
<div class="p20" style="font-size:1.5em;line-height:6em">➡️</div>
<Table
titles={["seats"]}
rows={[
  ["-"],
  ["2 (Round Down 2.2 seats)"],
  ["3 (Round Up 2.8 seats)"],
  ["-"],
  ["3 (Round Up 2.51 seats)"],
  ["2 (Round Down 2.39 seats)"],
]} />

</div>

But now let's add another state, Logicia, but let's not change the number of seats and the populations of the states. So redistributing the populations of the states we get the following

<div class="f tc mx-a j-ar scroll-x">
<Table
titles={["state", "population", "share"]}
rows={[
  ["Reasongrad", 1650, "33%"],
  ["Analyticaland", 1600, "32%"],
  ["Logicia", 1750, "35%"],
]} />
<div class="p20" style="font-size:1.5em;line-height:3em">➡️</div>
<Table
titles={["seats"]}
rows={[
  ["2 (Round Up 1.65 seats)"],
  ["2 (Round Up 1.6 seats)"],
  ["2 (Round Up 1.75 seats)"],
]} />
</div>

But now suddenly we need 6 seats, when we have only 5. So who do we round down?

### Hamilton's Method
The way this was first proposed to be solved it keep rounding up from the number closest to the next integer till whoever else is left gets rounded down even if they're closer to the next integer. This is called the [Hamilton's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_remainder_method). So in this case we would round up Reasongrad and Analyticaland and round down Logicia. So we actually get 2 seats for Reasongrad and Analyticaland and 1 seat for Logicia. This method is exactly what was also first proposed for Alabama in 1792.

So if some state needs 0.3 more seats to round up to 3 (from 2.7) they will be rounded up to 3 even if there exists a state with 26.6 seats that needs 0.4 more seats to round up to 27. This allows for what would be 'fair' rounding since a given state is closest to the next integer. The problem arises when we add just 1 more seat. Then which number is closest to the next integer jumps around completely randomly. Consider the below actual example from Alabama (sorted by descending remaining fraction)

<div class="f tc mx-a j-ar scroll-x">
<Table
titles={["state", "population", "percent", "share", "remaining fraction"]}
rows={[
  ["A", 3_252, "8.1%", 3.49, 0.49],
  ["B", 21_878, "54.6%", 23.47, 0.47],
  ["C", 4_167, "10.4%", 4.47, 0.47],
  ["D", 9_731, "24.2%", 10.42, 0.42],
  ["E", 1_065, "2.7%", 1.14, 0.14]
]}
label="43 seats"
/>
<div class="p20" style="font-size:1.5em;line-height:6em">vs</div>
<Table
titles={["state", "population", "percent", "share", "remaining fraction"]}
rows={[
  ["D", 9_731, "24.2%", 10.66, 0.66],
  ["C", 4_167, "10.4%", 4.57, 0.58],
  ["A", 3_252, "8.1%", 3.57, 0.57],
  ["E", 1_065, "2.7%", 1.17, 0.17],
  ["B", 21_878, "54.6%", 24.02, 0.02]
]}
label="44 seats"
/>
</div>

Notice how with these numbers with just 1 more seat, while first A and B were getting extra seats, now D and C are getting extra seats, and A in fact lost a seat. This is a problem because the number of seats is not a continuous function of the population. It is a discrete function. So the number of seats jumps around semi-randomly. This is called the [Alabama Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_paradox).

(The method was then veto'd by President Mr Washington, but for a different reason alltogether, it was a law interpretation difference [See Apportionment Act of 1792](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_Act_of_1792).)

### Jefferson's Method
Get ready for a whole new level of shitfuckery.

Jefferson proposed that the 'divisors' for all states are set the SAME such that they all get rounded down first. And the number of seats are added. The same divisor is then gradually decreased till we reach the required number of seats

<Table
titles={["state", "population", "portion"]}
rows={[
  ["Reasongrad", 1650, `1650/1000 = 16.5`],
  ["Analyticaland", 1600, `1600/1000 = 16.0`],
  ["Logicia", 1750, `1750/1000 = 17.5`]
]} />

<div class="f tc mx-a j-ar scroll-x">
<Table mini
titles={["seats"]}
label="Force Round Down"
rows={[[1], [1], [1]]} />
<div class="p20" style="font-size:1em;line-height:8em">vs</div>
<Table mini
titles={["seats"]}
label="Reduce to 850"
rows={[[1], [1], [2]]} />
<div class="p20" style="font-size:1em;line-height:8em">vs</div>
<Table mini
titles={["seats"]}
label="Reduce to 820"
rows={[[2], [1], [2]]} />
</div>

This was actually the method they went with from 1792 to 1840. The one massive problem with this issue is, as we decrease the denominator, since its a fraction, larger numbers increase faster. So say 1000/50 = 20 and 1000/40 = 25 whereas 100/50 = 2 and 100/40 = 2.5, notice how for a state with a 1000 population they gained 5 seats whereas the 100 population state gained only 0.5 seat which they may or may not even get. So the larger states get more seats faster than the smaller states. This is called the [Jefferson's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_method).

### Adam's Method
Adam's method exactly the same as Jefferson's method except rather than force round down and then slowly decrease the denominator, we force round UP and slowly increase the denominator. This is called the [Adam's Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_method). The Jefferson method favours the larger states and the Adam's method favours the smaller states (for the same reason, since large numbers move faster, the larger states also lose seats faster).

### Violating the Quota Rule
Consider the following data generated graciously by Mr. Matt Parker (linked in See Also)
![Data](https://i.imgur.com/WQcE5mV.png)

Notice how New Triangle jumped from 23.47 to 22. Which should technically not be allowed since rounding can happen only up or down to the next or previous number. Jumping numbers is not allowed in the [Quota Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quota_rule). This was a common occurance in both the Jefferson and Adam's method. The reason to why this was allowed to stay for so long was because the Jefferson Rule favoured big states. And guess who had more power (more votes)? Big states -\_-.
