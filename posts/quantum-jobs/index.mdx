## Introduction
With a new technology around the corner that is supposedly coming for all our jobs, again, like every
technology before was supposed to, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at what quantum
computing is, what it isn't, and what it could be.


## Quantum Computing Overview

<!-- types of computers -->
- Superconducting Qubits (both circuits or annealers) - IBM, Google, DWAVE, Rigetti, Alibaba
- Trapped Ions - Honeywell, IonQ
- Photonic Qubits - Xanadu, PsiQuantum 
- Topological Insulators - Microsoft
- Spin Qubits - Intel


- NISQ - Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum
