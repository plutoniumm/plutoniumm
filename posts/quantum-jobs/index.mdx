## Introduction
With a new technology around the corner that is supposedly coming for all our jobs, again, like every
technology before was supposed to, I thought it would be a good idea to take a look at what quantum
computing is, what it isn't, and what it could be.


## Quantum Computing Overview

<!-- types of computers -->
- Superconducting Qubits (both circuits or annealers) - IBM, Google, DWAVE, Rigetti, Alibaba
- Trapped Ions - Honeywell, IonQ
- Photonic Qubits - Xanadu, PsiQuantum
- Topological Insulators - Microsoft
- Spin Qubits - Intel

<!-- Superconducting qubits use Josephson junctions integrated into semiconductor chips to create artificial atoms called 'artificial spins'. These qubits can be linked together in groups, allowing for more complex computations. Trapped ions are atomic nuclei confined by electric fields in small spaces, creating highly stable qubit states. Photonic qubits utilize optical fibers to manipulate light pulses, which can represent information in the form of time-bin encoding. Topological insulator-based quantum computing leverages the conductive surface states of materials like silicene or graphene to create robust qubits. Lastly, spin qubits exploit the magnetic moments of electrons stored in nanostructures, typically germanium or silicon, to encode information. -->
