## Math is art
Mathematicians rarely talk about math as a subject but almost always as an art form

## Math is not subject or a science or a tool or a language
It is all of them.

EVen as a language understanding math takes effort. Having someone watch anime and then expecting them to be able to navigate Japan is not going to work. You need to learn the language in much more depth. So a sheet of paper with markov statistics to someone who has barely done grade 12 math is basically Japanese.

## Education Tests the wrong thing
- Education Tests proxies since we don't know how to check learning -> Goodhart's law
- No simple way will have to uproot the entire system


## Knowing math benefits everyone
```yaml
Doctor: If you do a chemo your chances of survival are 88% whereas if you don't do it your chances of survival are 84%
Patient: So if I don't do a chemo I die?
```

Situations like this is REALLY where we can save 1M$ of a poor person because doing chemo is expensive and a 4% chance is slim.
