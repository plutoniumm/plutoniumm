## MistakeJS Usage
Mistake is a simple wrapper around fetch to talk to my server to compile Svelte components. If you have to use this something somewhere has catastrophically gone wrong i.e you have made a mistake.

I may support other frameworks if needed as long as
- They are not JSX based. I can't deal with leaky abstractions.
- They are not VDOM based. The objective is to sacrifice speed not throw it out altogether.

### Usage
```html
<script async defer src="//manav.ch/mistake.js"></script>

<!-- Multiple components also work -->
<script type="svelte" name="sv-count" src="App.svelte"></script>
<sv-count></sv-count>
```

This will fetch App.svelte and compile it as a web component of `type=svelte` with the tag name `sv-count`

## Example Svelte file
As long as you don't have any local file dependencies, you should generally be able to compile any self contained pure component. You can also use `import` statements to import modules from npm.
```svelte
<script>
  // Sufficiently complex file
  import { onMount } from "svelte";
  import { transition_in } from "svelte/internal";

  // all modules will be auto-injected
  import moment from "moment";

  let i = 0;

  onMount(() => {
    const ctr =
      setInterval(() => (i++), 1000);

    console.log(moment().format("dddd"));

    return () => clearInterval(ctr);
  });
</script>

<h1 class="gr" style="color:red;">{i}</h1>

<style>
  .gr {
    background: green;
  }
</style>
```
