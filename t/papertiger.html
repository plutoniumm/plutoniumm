    <h2>This will end programmers</h2>
<h3>2012-2014</h3>
<p><em>Thank you School Teacher</em></p>
<p>I was in Grade 7 and my school had a computer lab. My teacher first taught me how to write an HTML tag and make a basic webpage with my name and a form on it. He then taught me how to use inspect element and put my name on a random video on youtube. My friends were surprised‚Ä¶ for like 3 seconds. Nevertheless those 3 seconds were magical üòè</p>
<p>HTML5 was not yet a W3C recommendation so we wrote a hybrid of HTML4/5. And that means‚Ä¶</p>
    <marquee>&lt;marquee&gt;This shit existed&lt;/marquee&gt;</marquee>
<p>and that <code>&lt;font&gt;</code> was still a tag, or that multimedia &amp; flash were still supported. nay, required.</p>
<p>In a random conversation with a college student he told me ‚ÄúWhy are you learning to code, you can just use wordpress. It will end programming as a job when every Tom Dick and Harry can just use plugins on wordpress‚Äù. (It is at this point I did not know who in India was actually named Tom, Dick or Harry)</p>
<p>I was slightly confused but decide to keep that in mind. Because afterall what does a 12 year old know? When I asked my teacher the next day about it he said don‚Äôt worry, ‚ÄúSomeone will always need your skillset as a programmer. But if you genuinely believe he‚Äôs right. Just learn wordpress too!‚Äú. And so I did.</p>
<p>Programming has not died yet.</p>
<h3>2014-2016</h3>
<p><em>Thank you IntelliJ</em></p>
<p>I was trying to make mobile apps at this point, Android Studio, a close to replica of IntelliJ IDEA but based on Gradle was released and MVP was still <em>a</em> thing before everyone decided MVVM was <strong>the</strong> thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>the amount of gymnastics IntelliJ did to make 1 green play button work was insane. <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenInTheBuff/status/1690899562179993601" rel="nofollow">Gradle gave me many Nightmares</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Adobe released Dreamweaver with HTML5, and in version CS6, their biggest update in a while. And again someone came along and said don‚Äôt think about all this. ‚ÄúAppyPie and other no-code is the future of mobile programming, you don‚Äôt need to learn all this stuff, just drag and drop and you‚Äôre done.‚Äù</p>
<p>This time I decided to not learn no-code and dropped mobile dev altogether. I have since not touched mobile dev, and I don‚Äôt think I will.</p>
<p>But nevertheless, mobile dev has not died yet.</p>
<h3>2016-2019</h3>
<p><em>Thank you Theprimeagen</em></p>
<p>I needed a way to send a lot of data as a graph and just call it magically on the frontend. So I then discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8UgDZ4rXBU" rel="nofollow">Falcor</a>.</p>
<p>I was too dumb to use falcor and probably used it in the stupidest way possible. Note: it was made for Multi-Billion Startup Netflix. Not a teenager with a hello world. But nevertheless you could just <code>npm install</code> and <code>model.get</code>. AND. IT. WORKED. That was a level of magic I had not seen before. (I now know in hind sight it was black magic and he‚Äôs still touchy about <a href="https://github.com/Netflix-Skunkworks/repulsive-grizzly" rel="nofollow">Repulsive Grizzly</a>) (This man will cameo again)</p>
<p>I needed to build a complex website with a blog, lot of data about various countries, their candidates etc for a Model UN. I wanted to play more with Falcor.</p>
<p>But once again someone came around and said, ‚ÄúWix released Wix Code, an API to interact with their database services and add some custom scripting. You don‚Äôt need to do any more of this stupid programming stuff. Just use Wix.‚Äù And. So. I. did.</p>
<p>But programming has still not died. (Falcor Has.)</p>
<h3>2019-2023</h3>
<p><em>Thank you Dr. Radhika Vathsan (my Quantum prof)</em></p>
<p>The ‚ÄòRona took a lot from a lot of people but it gave me 1 year to just stop all else. (including University bullshit) and go all out on learning coding. I consumed more blogs, npm packages and videos than I ever could and programmed sometimes for 18 hrs a day.</p>
<p>Someone again came along and told me Quantum Computers will get rid of the need for DSA. It can solve NP-Complete problems fast. So now what to do? Well. I already am a Mathematician. Let‚Äôs do Quantum Computing then.</p>
<p>Boy were they wrong, for unrelated technical reasons which I don‚Äôt need to get into. But the moral of which I realised, was, Doomers are always wrong. They are just people who are too lazy to single mindedly dedicate themselves to something and so they try to convince others that it‚Äôs not worth it. <em>There is a doomer for everything. Including being a doomer.</em></p>
<p>Programming has still not died.</p>
<h3>2023 - Present</h3>
<p><em>Thank you Copilot (it literally autocompleted this itself)</em></p>
<p>It‚Äôs lost on no one that the AI race is here never before has there been a population this large being doomer on AI. As a standard rule. Everytime 2 sides argue for more than 5 minutes. Both of you are wrong. But that here implies, that programming will not end. But it won‚Äôt be unimpacted either. So what will happen?</p>
<p>The problem now is that a new generation of kids is coming in completely <strong>dependent</strong> on AI. They are used to asking Alexa to play music, they are used to asking Siri to set alarms, they are used to asking Google to find things. This will widen the gulf between good and bad coders by so much that America can sail their entire Navy through it.</p>
<p>This means you will now have to work much much much harder to get into programming professionally. This means that those with means will do better even more than before. This means that large swaths of test writing, stupid function generation, dockerfiling etc will get automated away.</p>
<blockquote><p>TURN THE FUCKING LSP, SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING AND COPILOT OFF if you‚Äôre a student. Learn to code with just notepad and add ONE of the above super powers every few months. Assuming all libraries present, you should be able to just spew out code on an airplane. (For those reading in the future, Airplanes did‚Äôt have internet yet.). And for the love of god use Vim.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is also when I rediscovered a certain <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/15dfyip/meme/" rel="nofollow">CEEEEO</a> of a small Multi-Billion Startup. well I guess that‚Äôs <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theprimeagen" rel="nofollow">FIVE DOLLARS A MONTH</a>, gone now. Hho echoes similar sentiments and some other ideas. Here‚Äôs three of them (Appealing to authority is also a strong argument)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDd71IUIgpg" rel="nofollow">Zero</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/dQYXM4U831A" rel="nofollow">One</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" rel="nofollow">Two</a></p>
<p>Over the last 60 years.</p>
<ul><li>Compilers did not make programming go away, it just changed how we do it, with higher level languages</li>
<li>Dreamweaver did not make programming go away, it just showed us a better way of seeing it</li>
<li>Wordpress did not make programming go away, it just made it faster for some standardised use cases</li>
<li>No-Code did not make programming go away it in fact got more poeple into mobile dev</li>
<li>LSP did not automate away code generation it just made it faster to check for errors, write specifications and documentation</li>
<li>Quantum Computing will not make programming go away, it will just speed up like some integer % of the use cases</li>
<li>AI will not make programming go away, it will just make it harder to get into.</li></ul>
<p>This DOES NOT mean, that programming will end. It will just get harder.</p>
<p>HASKELL MENTIONED!!! LFG.</p></article>
