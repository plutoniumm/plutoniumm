## Software Engineering follows the laws of Genetic Evolution

The 3 requirements for evolution are:
1. Variation
2. Selection
3. Heredity

In the animal kingdom it is common to see evolution in action. Every animal makes small changes and the best change survives. This also means however that big swooping changes don't occur. And if we're stuck in a local minima, only an asteroid can reset the system. Obviously the good parts of evolution are easy to see

- People fork code and make small changes
- The best code survives
- The best code is copied and used in other projects

(vim btw)
